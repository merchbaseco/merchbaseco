RankWrangler started as a simple spreadsheet to answer a single question: *how are our listings actually performing?* The deeper we dug, the clearer it became that tracking rankings, ad performance, and keyword strength in real time was the missing ingredient for most print on demand sellers.

Today, we are excited to share the first public look at RankWrangler. The platform aggregates live marketplace data, surfaces growth opportunities, and highlights when your listings start to slip. Instead of tab-hopping across marketplaces and ad dashboards, you get a single source of truth tailored for creatives who sell at scale.

Over the coming weeks we will publish tutorials on building keyword lists, spotting seasonal trends, and automating reporting. In the meantime, we would love to hear the workflows and dashboards you want us to prioritize.
