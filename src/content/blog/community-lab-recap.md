Every quarter we gather a group of power sellers to stress test new workflows inside the MerchBase Community Lab. This season focused on faster artwork approvals and clearer communication between creative teams and fulfillment partners.

Participants reduced turnaround time by 18% on average without sacrificing quality. The winning approach combined standardized briefs, real-time status updates, and daily retros that surfaced blockers before they snowballed.

Next quarter we are exploring automated compliance reviews and print-ready checks. If you would like to join the beta cohort, sign up for updates and share your shop's biggest bottlenecks.
