We started MerchBase because the print on demand community deserves software that feels like it was crafted just for them—polished interfaces, reliable data, and playful touches that make long listing sessions less of a grind. Today we are excited to officially launch MerchBase.co and invite you to take the first steps with us.

MerchBase is a growing collection of bespoke tools built by sellers, for sellers. Our first release, **RankWrangler**, pulls Best Seller Rank and listing details directly into Amazon search so you can spot winning designs without juggling spreadsheets. The browser extension is free, works in Chrome and Safari, and ships with the design polish and stability we expect from the products we build.

Beyond the launch extension, we are investing in a living knowledge base of notes, snippets, and experiments that help the community stay ahead of trends. When you explore the new site you will find a home page that reflects who we are—humans who care about craft, community, and giving fellow creatives the tools to thrive.

This is just the start. We will be rolling out more utilities, deeper analytics, and ways for you to shape the roadmap. Subscribe to the blog, share your feedback, and join us in building the merch toolkit we have all been waiting for.
