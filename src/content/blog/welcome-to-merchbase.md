Hey there, I'm Zach, and for first time readers, I've been in the Print on Demand industry for nearly a decade. More about that later though... to jump right into it: I am so excited to announce the launch of MerchBase!

MerchBase is more than just a website, or a blog... it's an all-encompassing studio where I can bring helpful products, tools, and resources to the PoD community. Sellers and designers need all sorts of tools to help them succeed on marketplaces like Amazon and Etsy. MerchBase builds those tools differently than everybody else: we are obsessed with beauty, quality, and usability. That means...

1. Less bugs to deal with!
2. Browser extensions that don't junk up the websites they run on, or your computer!
3. Actual data-backed information & guides in the form of blog articlewheres.
4. And more, all in service of the community that makes PoD special.

There is a lot of work to do, but just to give you a sense of where we're going:

The first product from MerchBase is called RankWrangler, and it's a browser extension that inserts best seller rank (BSR) and other useful product data directly into the search results on Amazon.com, making it truly simple to spot what's working (and what's not) as sellers research the market on Amazon. More on that soon!

If you're reading this, and you identify with the mission, then welcome! I'm so excited for this journey.
