Responsible sourcing is an ongoing practice, not a box to check. At MerchBase we evaluate every supplier on environmental impact, labor protections, and the transparency of their material inputs. That diligence gives creators confidence that the products they release align with their values.

In this playbook we break down the questions we ask factories, the certifications we look for, and the way we audit sample runs. These systems help our partners avoid costly recalls and build long-term trust with their customers.

We will continue updating this guide as new materials come to market and regulations evolve. If you are tackling your own supplier audit, let us know the roadblocks so we can address them in future updates.
