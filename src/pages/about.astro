          MerchBase is a research and product studio focused on helping creators launch
          responsible merchandise lines without sacrificing speed or quality. We combine
          data-backed experimentation with an obsession for craft so sellers can design,
          produce, and deliver pieces that live up to their brand values.

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">Our mission</h2>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            We believe print-on-demand can be a powerful channel for independent creators—if the
            tooling is transparent, sustainable, and collaborative. MerchBase exists to make that
            vision real. We partner with a network of vetted suppliers, build software that puts
            seller insights front and center, and facilitate a community lab where power users help
            steer the roadmap.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            Every workflow we design is measured against three principles: quality that delights
            fans, ethical production that respects people and the planet, and knowledge sharing that
            lifts the whole community. When those align, creators can scale their merch operations
            with confidence.

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">Meet the founder</h2>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            MerchBase was founded by Zach Knickerbocker, a software developer turned entrepreneur
            based in Manhattan. After refining his craft inside Amazon, Zach set out to build a
            portfolio of digital assets and eCommerce brands, ultimately creating MerchBase to give
            independent sellers the operational edge he wished existed when he got started.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            Today, he leads the studio with a builder&apos;s mindset—pairing technical rigor with a deep
            respect for creative communities. Zach remains hands-on with product strategy, supplier
            relationships, and the mentorship programs that guide new creators through the ups and
            downs of self-employment.
